# ops_challenges

## Welcome! 

### What is this repo all about?
     This repo hosts all of my coding challenges, and a few odds and ends.

### Why are you learning these skills?
     I'm learning PowerShell and Bash to allow me to automate processes.

### What fundamental concepts did you learn in Ops 201?
     I learned the basics of scripting! I got an introduction to
     some simple scripting and learned a lot about the CLI

### What was your favorite Ops Challenge assignment and why?
     I really enjoyed the standUp scripts that we did. 
     It gave me some really fun ideas that I want to try.

### How can these examples of shell scripting be applied to the workplace?
     Many of these scripts automate certain things, or are designed to help prep
     a new computer to be ready to use. I can see this being very useful
     in the real world.

### What scripts would you continue to improve if you had the time?
     If I had more time I would prbably work on every one of them a bit more.
     But they work well enough for now, so thats not a priority right now.

### What aspect of your shell scripting skillset do you hope to improve next?
     I need to learn more common commands and the syntax. Once I become more 
     familar with the in's and out's of the languages I'll be much
     more efficent.
